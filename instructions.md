### My strategy

1. Prepare data
Seed function is given, we can run seed.py to seed the dataset into a csv, simulating a db

2. Prepare tests

* Think of the test case
* Write pytest tests


3. Implement code

* For now, I can think of the functions
    * load_data
    * clean_data
    * consecutive_logins
    * sort
    * save_table
