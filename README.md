# Supahands Coding Assessment
* This is a coding asssessment for prospective supahands engineers
* Bear in mind that you want to be **VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO SHOW OFF!!!!** Think of this coding assessment as an audition


## Problem Statement
* Given a list of time stamps that is generated by the provided seed.py, where the timestamps represent login time
* Length is defined as the number of days of consecutive logins, NOT the number of consecutive logins
* Output a table with time stamps sorted by consecutive logins, sorted by descending length
* For example, if given the following timestamps 
  * ['2021-03-13 15:13:05', '2021-03-13 23:13:05', '2021-03-16 15:13:05', '2021-03-16 23:13:05', '2021-03-17 07:13:05', '2021-03-17 15:13:05', '2021-03-17 23:13:05', '2021-03-18 07:13:05', '2021-03-18 15:13:05']
* DO NOT use the example above as input
* Since the longest period of consecutive logins occur from 2021-03-16 to 2021-03-18, the answer would be

| START      | END        | LENGTH |
|------------|------------|--------|
| 2021-03-16 | 2021-03-18 |      3 |
| 2021-03-13 | 2021-03-13 |      1 |


* The problem stems from needing to award badges for consecutive logins

## Submission Instructions
* Fork the project [here](https://replit.com/@Kaizenx/software-engineering-test-redux)
* You can solve the problem using either python, javascript, or ruby
* Use the seed file to generate your output
* Use the seed file **AS IS**, do not modify the inherent logic of the seed file
* However, feel free to create js or rb versions of the seed file without modifying the inherent logic in the python original
* Do not copy the logic of the seed file into your code
* Notify [careers@supahands.com](mailto:careers@supahands.com) upon completion and include the join link for your replit.com project
* Solutions that do not follow the submission instructions WILL NOT be considered
* Remember to include unit tests either as separate files or using the replit test functionality
* **REMINDER DO NOT** edit or amend the seed file
* Include a separate readme in the form of a **instructions.txt** if additional instructions are required to get your solution running, such as installing libraries
* Your solution should follow best practices such as DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID etc.
* Feel free to use 3rd party libraries
* Solutions that do not follow the submission instructions WILL NOT be considered

## Hints
* We **WILL NOT** be processing submissions that do not match the output format as stipulated in Outputs
* You are **ENCOURAGED** to re-attempt the assessment in the event that you do not do well enough in the first attempt

## Assessment Criteria
* Submitted code will be assessed based on the following criteria
  * Does it work? The solution should work in replit or codecollab
  * Do we have tests, and do they work?
  * Is the code clearly documented?
  * Did the candidate read the README and comprehended the instructions in the README?
  * Defensibility - Does the code handle dirty data, incorrect input data, attacks?
  * Maintainability - Is the code written with small discrete functions, using either a functional or object oriented approach
  * Best practices - Good test coverage, good tests, testing both positive and negative outcomes, good naming of methods and functions in the code
  * Run time or space efficiency vs Input Growth - Write the most optimal code possible
* The gist is that the candidate should write production quality code


## Expected Outputs
* During the assessment we expect an output of the following format

| START      | END        | LENGTH |
|------------|------------|--------|
| 2021-03-03 | 2021-03-10 |      8 |
